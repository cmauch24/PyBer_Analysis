# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary data frame of the ride-sharing data by city type and use that data frame to show how different types of cities use ridesharing to assist PyBer with decision making going forward. 

## Results
As the analysis shows, urban areas are PyBer’s most heavily utilized markets. During the period of time analyzed, there were 1625 rides in urban markets compared with 625 in suburban and 125 in rural. However, the urban market was the only one with fewer riders than drivers in market, with 2405 urban drivers, 490 suburban drivers, and 78 rural. 

Given this trend, we see rural drivers having higher fares per driver. Rural drivers had an average fare of $55.49 per driver, higher than the suburban market ($39.50) and more than three times higher than the urban market ($16.57). While not as strong, this trend held true when looking at average fare per ride ($35.62 rural, $30.97 suburban, $24.53 urban).

For rides based on the time of year in the months analyzed, we noticed a fairly consistent trend across all three markets, with a little more volatility during the month of March in the urban market.

## Summary
In summary, the urban market is the most heavily utilized market for PyBer, but that doesn’t mean it is where all the attention should lie. The suburban and urban markets are underserved when it comes to PyBer drivers and also have a higher earnings potential per ride based on the data collected and analyzed. It is recommended that PyBer look into investing resources in the rural and suburban markets to increase utilization across all market types.
